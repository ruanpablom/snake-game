Snake is a timeless video game that has gained immense popularity, especially on early mobile phones like the Nokia. In this game, players take control of a small snake, guiding it through a maze-like arena. The objective is to maneuver the snake to eat dots or objects scattered across the screen, which causes the snake to grow longer. As the snake grows, the challenge intensifies as players must navigate carefully to avoid colliding with their own tail or the boundaries of the playing field. The ultimate goal is to achieve the highest score possible by growing the snake as long as possible without any collisions. With its simple yet addictive gameplay, Snake has captivated players for years.
